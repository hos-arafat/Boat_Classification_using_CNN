# Boat_Classification_using_CNN
A Convolutional Neural Network that classifies the type of boat in the image into 1 of 3 possible classes

This project was initially conducted by Sapienza University of Rome and the City of Venice to monitor and control marine traffic along the Venice Grand Canal
by installing multiple "Survey Cells" comprising of an array of Cameras and using Computer Vision and Machine Learning techniques Algorithms to process the 
output of these cameras.
