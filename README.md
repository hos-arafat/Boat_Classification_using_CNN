# Boat_Classification_using_CNN

A Convolutional Neural Network that classifies the type of boat in the image into 1 of 3 possible classes

This project is a simplification of a more complicated real-world project that was initially conducted by The Sapienza University of Rome and the City of Venice to monitor and control marine traffic along the Venice Grand 
Canal by installing multiple "Survey Cells" comprising of an array of Cameras and using Computer Vision and Machine Learning techniques Algorithms to process 
the output of these cameras.

The ropository contains a Python Code as well as a Jupyter Notebook of 6-Layer Convolutional Neural Netwrok that takes a color image of a boat as input, 
processes it and converts it to Gray Scale and outputs the class of the boat.

The image processing is done using OpenCV and the Neural Network is written using TF-Learn which is an abstraction layer on top of TensorFlow.
